# Hardware for the BG-Boy

The BG-Boy was designed as part of a course at the [Bismarck Gymnasium
in Karlsruhe, Germany](http://bismarck-gymnasium.de/). The intention
was to show children in a hand-on approach all steps from the basic
project idea to a working prototype using a custom designed PCB and a
3D printed prototype case. The entire project was meant to be simple
enough to be assembled by fifth grade kids and cheap enough to give
each kid a free device.

The resulting device ran on a single 1,5 AA cell and was compatible
with the Arduino2/Slimboy project.
